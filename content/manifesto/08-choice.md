# The Choice Before Us

The AI revolution presents three broad futures:

- **Dystopian Oligarchy.** Intelligence monopolies, deep inequality, and survival rationed by corporate terms of service.
- **Luddite Retreat.** Rejection of technology that leads to scarcity, stagnation, and cultural brittleness.
- **The Empowerment Economy.** A distributed system that disperses agency, guarantees survival, and invites plural futures.

Only the third option respects autonomy while embracing progress. It is the future that free people would choose even if they did not know the life they were born into.
