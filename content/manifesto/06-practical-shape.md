# Practical Architecture

The Empowerment Economy becomes real through concrete systems and standards:

- **Universal Economic Identity.** A secure, portable digital identity from birth that connects rights, accounts, and entitlements across jurisdictions.
- **AI as Universal Bureaucracy.** Personal AI agents that file taxes, negotiate contracts, ensure compliance, and surface rights in plain language.
- **Universal Basic Income.** Funded by automation-era productivity to provide the floor on which agency and experimentation stand.
- **Universal Healthcare.** Decoupled from employment so dignity and health are not contingent on payroll status.
- **Universal Technology Access.** Connectivity, compute, and AI tools treated as 21st-century literacy; guaranteed as a public utility.
- **Distributed AI Infrastructure.** Open standards and public-interest compute to prevent intelligence monopolies and to keep power dispersed.

Each element is necessary; together they form the infrastructure for freedom in an AI-dense economy.
