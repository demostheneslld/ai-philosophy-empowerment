# The Empowerment Economy

The Empowerment Economy sets out a moral, political, and economic blueprint for the AI age. It begins from a simple observation: productivity is soaring while the institutions that once guaranteed survival are fracturing. The goal of this project is to articulate a credible, community-driven alternative that treats every person as a sovereign economic actor supported by shared infrastructure.

This repository hosts the living manifesto, policy frameworks, and philosophical foundations of that alternative. It is intentionally simple: plain Markdown in the open, rendered to minimalist HTML for easy reading and remixing. Contributions are welcome from anyone prepared to stress-test, refine, and extend the ideas.

Use the navigation links to explore manifesto chapters, philosophical roots, and policy design notes. Or jump straight to the contribution guidelines to add new thinking, critiques, case studies, or historical parallels.
