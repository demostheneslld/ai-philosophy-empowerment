# Philosophical Foundations

The Empowerment Economy stands on centuries of moral and political thought, reframed for a world where intelligence can be automated.

- **Rawls — Veil of Ignorance.** No rational agent would choose a system that ties survival to jobs that are guaranteed to disappear.
- **Rousseau — Social Contract.** A portion of AI-driven productivity must be ceded to guarantee universal survival and dignity.
- **Kant — Dignity.** Humans are never disposable inputs; labour markets that reduce people to replaceable parts violate that principle.
- **Sen & Nussbaum — Capabilities.** True freedom requires health, education, and participation. Without access to AI tools those capabilities wither.
- **Aristotle & Arendt — Flourishing.** Automation can free humanity from drudgery, creating the space for excellence, creativity, and political life.
- **Nietzsche — Risk and Creation.** Guarantees empower courage and experimentation; they are the stage on which struggle becomes creative.
- **Jeffersonian Tradition — Sovereignty.** Where land once signified independence, today it is digital and economic agency.
- **Foucault & Marx — Warnings.** Monopolised intelligence becomes domination. Distributed agency disperses power and resists capture.

This synthesis grounds the manifesto in familiar ethical terrain while insisting that new technological realities require fresh institutional responses.
