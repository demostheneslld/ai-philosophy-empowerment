# Defining the Empowerment Economy

The Empowerment Economy rests on a new social contract organised around agency, guarantees, and shared infrastructure.

- **Every person is their own enterprise.** Not as a corporate shell, but as a recognition that individuals own their agency, risk, and creative output.
- **AI secures agency.** Personal AI agents handle contracts, taxes, compliance, and rights, ensuring that no one is buried under bureaucracy or dependent on monopolies for basic coordination.
- **Universal guarantees anchor survival.** Income, healthcare, and technology access become non-negotiable infrastructure. They are not charity but the baseline that enables risk-taking, creativity, and flourishing.

These commitments turn abundance into freedom. They make space for experimentation while preventing the collapse that comes from tying survival to obsolete institutions.
