# Principles of the Empowerment Economy

1. **Dignity.** Survival and healthcare are guaranteed because human worth does not hinge on market usefulness.
2. **Agency.** Every person wields a sovereign economic identity and an AI agent to negotiate, contract, and defend their interests.
3. **Access.** Universal access to technology, including AI, ensures no one is excluded from participation, education, or innovation.
4. **Risk Infrastructure.** Guarantees provide the baseline that lets people fail, learn, and try again without catastrophic collapse.
5. **Sovereignty.** AI infrastructure must be distributed to prevent monopoly control over the means of intelligence.
6. **Flourishing.** True freedom is the capacity to pursue excellence, creativity, and meaning beyond mere survival.

These principles convert abstract philosophy into design criteria for policy, governance, and technology deployment.
