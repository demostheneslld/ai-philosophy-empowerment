# How to Get Involved

The Empowerment Economy stays alive because people keep refining, challenging, and extending it. You do not need to be a programmer to participate.

## Contribute in three steps

1. **Open a Markdown file in `content/`.** Each piece begins with a short front-matter block that sets the title, category, order, and description.
2. **Write or revise the text.** Plain Markdown is enough—headings, lists, bold, italics, and links all work. Focus on clarity and actionable ideas.
3. **Submit your changes.** Open a pull request (or use GitHub’s web editor) and the automated build will regenerate the public site for you.

## Optional local preview

If you want to see the rendered HTML before submitting, run `python scripts/build.py` and open `docs/index.html`. The directory is ignored by git, so you never have to commit generated files.

## What to add

- New manifesto chapters or critiques that sharpen existing ones.
- Policy frameworks describing funding models, governance, or community infrastructure.
- Philosophical touchstones, comparative analyses, or historical parallels.
- Questions and prompts that invite collective research.

## Where to discuss

Open GitHub Issues for substantial proposals, requests for feedback, or research threads. Draft pull requests are welcome if you want early review.

## Keep it accessible

- Use short paragraphs and descriptive headings.
- Cite sources inline and add links where context helps.
- Assume readers may come from outside the tech sector.

For full contribution details, see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repository root.
